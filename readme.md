Tom Leinster's book is CC 4.0 BY in the arxiv.
Adding both pdf and tex source from https://arxiv.org/format/1612.09375.
The NLP processing of the book is part of the project [Mathscope](https://github.com/ToposInstitute/tac-corpus)

We're processing the book to obtain concepts, relationships between them and argumentation trees.

We're also developing (with Andrea Ferreira) a project to do a similar work to all open-source books recommended by the AIM (American Institute of Mathematics)
[Open Textbook Initiative](https://textbooks.aimath.org/). 

There are already repositories for:
* [Abstract Algebra](https://github.com/andreago9/MathCorpus-AATA) (Tom Judson)
* [Linear Algebra](https://github.com/andreago9/MathCorpus-LAHefferonPDF) (Jim Hefferon)
